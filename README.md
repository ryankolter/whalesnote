1. **Privacy first**: local open source software that is not connected to the Internet, giving you complete control over the data.
2. **Markdown support**: Provide preview mode and two-column mode.
3. **Super-capacity** second brain: three-level directory structure can store at least 100 repositories * 50 categories * 60 notes = 300,000 notes.
4. Only takes **one second** to open: no matter how many notes you have, because it use segmentation based search system which won't load all notes at beginning.

Q: What is the benefit of two directory's structure?

A: By seperating app/node_modules from node_modules and building the js bundle file into app directory, we can minimize the packaging size of electron using electron-builder.
